    <h3>Tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches are best when the air turns crisp, the mornings are damp, and the days are short. The soup’s simplicity only accentuates its role as a tincture on a cold fall evening. Its velvety texture is a robe of warmth.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 tablespoons buttere</li>
        <li>1 large onion, yellow or white, diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed or dieced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>4 cups(32 ounces) low sodium chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Saute the onions and garlic:</h3>In a Dutch oven set over medium heat, add the butter. Once it starts to foam, add the onion, garlic, salt, and pepper. Stir until both have softened and are fragrant, about 7 minutes.</li>
        <li><h3>Make the roux:</h3>Add flour. Stir to make a paste. Continue stirring until the flour has taken on a light brown color. Stir and scrape with wooden spoon, 5 to 7 minutes. The onion paste should look golden with a little brown caramelization.</li>
        <li><h3>Add tomatoes and stock:</h3>Add crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, chicken stock, and sugar. Stir to combine. Cover the pot and bring to a boil over medium high heat, then reduce heat to medium and let simmer uncovered for about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li><h3>Puree and serve:</h3>Purée the soup with an immersion blender. Alternatively, fill a countertop blender less than halfway with the hot soup. Remove the center lid insert. This allows the hot steam to escape. Cover the hole with a folded kitchen towel and place your hand over the top. Blend. Repeat as necessary until all of the soup has been puréed.</li>
    </ol>
